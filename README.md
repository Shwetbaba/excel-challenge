Using the raw data on your Excel workbook, modify and analyze the sample-project data and try to uncover market trends.

This dataset was created by Trilogy Education Services, a 2U, Inc. brand.

Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the outcome column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, canceled, or is currently live.

Create a new column called Percent Funded that uses a formula to find how much money a campaign made relative to its initial funding goal.
Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column according to a three-color scale. The scale should start at 0 with a dark shade of red, and it should transition to green at 100 and blue at 200.

Create a new column called Average Donation that uses a formula to find how much each project backer paid on average.

Create two new columns, one called Parent Category and another called Sub-Category, that use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into the two new, separate columns.

Create a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes your initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category.

Create a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the table that you created.

Create a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes your initial sheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently live per sub-category.

Create a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent category based on the table that you created.

The dates in the deadline and launched_at columns use Unix timestamps. Fortunately for us, this formula (Links to an external site.) that can be used to convert these timestamps to a normal date.

Create a new column named Date Created Conversion that will use this formula (Links to an external site.) to convert the data contained in launched_at into Excel's date format.

Create a new column named Date Ended Conversion that will use this formula (Links to an external site.) to convert the data contained in deadline into Excel's date format.

Create a new sheet with a pivot table that has a column of state, rows of Date Created Conversion, values based on the count of state, and filters based on parent category and Years.

Now, create a pivot-chart line graph that visualizes this new table.

Create a report in Microsoft Word, and answer the following questions:

Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
What are some limitations of this dataset?
What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
